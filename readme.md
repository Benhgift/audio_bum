Hi, I'm building a pitch changer

## quickstart: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This command below here only works in OSX

`python3 say_words_back_in_girl_voice.py`

This command below here will will increase your pitch by 100hz, but is robot and choppy and lame (WIP).

`python3 main.py --shift_pitch=100`
